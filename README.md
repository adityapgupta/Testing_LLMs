# Testing_LLMs
A short report on the performance of famous LLMs when they were asked to solve basic math problems. The models tested here were OpenAI's 'ChatGPT', Google's 'Bard' and Microsoft's 'Bing Chat'.  

The questions given to the LLM's were taken from OpenAI's grade school math dataset, which can be found at https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math/tree/master/grade_school_math/data

The models were tested using various prompting methods like zero shot, one shot, few shot and chain of thought.
